The main.py file contains the menu and it needs to be executed with python to work.

The read_data.py file is mainly used to get the stocks_data.csv to the program.

The stock_class.py file contains the Portfolio class and the Stocks class with the corresponding methods.

stocks_data.csv is just an example data file for the program. The first line contains the name for each stock and the following lines the price for each stock for the given dates.
